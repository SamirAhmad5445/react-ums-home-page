## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is about reverse engineering the home page of the university website [UMS](https://ums.asu.edu.eg/). The page contains various components such as sliders, tabs, and forms. It is a very useful experience and a great opportunity to practice reading other peopleâ€™s code as well as coding yourself. You will learn how to analyze the structure and style of a web page, and how to recreate it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge will test your creativity, problem-solving, and web development skills. Are you ready to take on this challenge? if the answer is yes take a look at [style-guide.md](/style-guide.md) and goof luck.

## My process

### This Challenge build with

- [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I Learned

One of the challenges of working on a large website like UMS is to manage a large amount of data, assets, and components. In this challenge, I took a new approach that I have never tried before in React. I implemented the SCSS module approach in the assets and components, and it works like this:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
|
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
| â”œâ”€â”€components/
| | â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentA.jsx
| | â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentB.css
| | â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentB.jsx
| | â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentC.jsx
â”‚ | â””â”€â”€ index.js
| |
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ sections/
| | â”œâ”€â”€ SectionA.jsx
| | â”œâ”€â”€ SectionB.jsx
â”‚ | â””â”€â”€ index.js
| |
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.css
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ App.jsx
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

In /App.jsx, I can import any component or section from the corresponding directories, thanks to the index.js files. My App.jsx looks like this:

```jsx
import { SectionA, SectionB } from "/sections";
import { ComponentC } from "./component";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <ComponentC />
      <SectionA />
      <SectionB />
    </main>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This way, I can easily keep track of the needed components in each part of the project. I also learned how to use SCSS variables, mixins, and nesting to make my CSS code more modular, readable, and reusable. I enjoyed this challenge a lot, and I hope you did too! ðŸ˜Š

### Continued Development

I want to learn backend development and create dynamic web apps. I want to connect my frontend with a server, database, and API. I want to try different technologies and frameworks, such as Node.js, Express, etc. I want to keep working on this project and improve my skills. And one day i'd have my own UMS. ðŸ˜‚
